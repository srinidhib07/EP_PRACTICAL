As you’re in the very beginning stage of learning how to create a XML document.
  Write an XML to accept student details [Name, ID, Branch and CGPA] for minimum 5 students.

<class>

<student>

<name> ABC </name>

<id> 001 </id>

<branch> IT </branch>

<cgpa> 9 </cgpa>

</student>

<student>




Write a program for Students information, and the XML file is created that contains                 
Student [id, regno, name, avg, dob, time, mobileno, distinction], the information about five students of different categories 
and displaying the XML file.
Sample Template:

<students_info>

<student>                               

   <regno>170024</regno>

   <name>ABC</name>   

   <avg>92</avg>

   <dob>15-08-1992</dob> 

   <time></time>      

   <mobile no="9849984900"/>                         

   <distinction>YES</distinction>

 </student>
